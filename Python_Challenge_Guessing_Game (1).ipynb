    "\n",
    "Write a program that picks a random integer from 1 to 100, and has players guess the number. The rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If a player's guess is less than 1 or greater than 100, say \"OUT OF BOUNDS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. On all turns, if a guess is \n",
    " * closer to the number than the previous guess return \"Closer!\"\n",
    " * farther from the number than the previous guess, return \"Farther!\"\n",
    "3. When the player's guess equals the number, tell them they've guessed correctly *and* how many guesses it took!\n",
